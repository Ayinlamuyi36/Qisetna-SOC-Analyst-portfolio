XML-RPC Exploit Attempt on qisetna.com
1. Overview
The XML-RPC interface in WordPress allows remote communication and supports functionalities like remote publishing and pingbacks. Unfortunately, it is often abused by attackers to perform brute force attacks or DDoS amplification.

On qisetna.com, several exploit attempts targeting XML-RPC were detected.

2. Detection
Monitored web server logs and WP Cerber traffic logs for abnormal POST requests to /xmlrpc.php.

Noticed spikes in traffic volume coming from specific IP addresses.

Requests showed patterns of system.multicall method calls, indicative of attack payloads.

3. Findings
IP Address	Attempts	Time Frame	Attack Type
203.0.113.120	1200	2025-06-19 22:10	Brute force multiping
198.51.100.77	800	2025-06-20 01:45	DDoS amplification

4. Mitigation
4.1 Disable XML-RPC
Disabled XML-RPC completely using WP Cerber settings to block all requests to /xmlrpc.php.

4.2 Cloudflare Rules
Created firewall rules to block all XML-RPC traffic from suspicious IPs.

Rate limited XML-RPC access globally.

4.3 WP Cerber Advanced Rules
Enabled strict XML-RPC filtering and blocking of known abuse patterns.

5. Recommendations
Keep WordPress and plugins updated.

Monitor for spikes in XML-RPC traffic.

Use Cloudflare Bot Fight Mode.

Educate team on signs of DDoS and brute force attacks.
