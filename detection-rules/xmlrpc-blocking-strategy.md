# XML-RPC Blocking Strategy for qisetna.com

## 1. Introduction  
The XML-RPC protocol in WordPress allows remote communication and execution of commands such as publishing posts, pingbacks, and remote login attempts. While useful, XML-RPC is a frequent target for attackers performing brute-force attacks, DDoS amplification, and other abuse. This document outlines the strategy to block or limit XML-RPC abuse to protect qisetna.com.

## 2. Risks of XML-RPC Abuse  
- **Brute-force login attacks:** Attackers use XML-RPCâ€™s `system.multicall` method to try thousands of password guesses in one request.  
- **DDoS amplification:** XML-RPC can be exploited to generate excessive server load.  
- **Pingback abuse:** Used to launch reflection attacks or spam.  

## 3. Blocking Strategies

### 3.1 Disable XML-RPC Entirely  
- If not required, disable XML-RPC to eliminate the attack surface.  
- Methods to disable:  
  - Use WordPress plugins like **Disable XML-RPC** or **WP Cerber** settings.  
  - Add code snippet to `functions.php` to block access:

  ```php
  add_filter('xmlrpc_enabled', '__return_false');
3.2 Limit XML-RPC Access
If XML-RPC is required (e.g., for Jetpack or remote publishing), restrict access:

Use Cloudflare firewall rules to allow XML-RPC access only from trusted IPs (e.g., Jetpack servers).

Configure .htaccess or Nginx to limit access or block suspicious IPs.

3.3 Rate Limiting
Apply rate limiting on /xmlrpc.php endpoint to prevent rapid-fire requests.

Use WP Cerber or Cloudflare rate limiting features.

Example: max 5 requests per IP per 10 minutes.

3.4 Monitoring and Alerting
Monitor access logs for unusual spikes in /xmlrpc.php requests.

Set up Kibana alerts for threshold breaches.

Use WP Cerber live traffic logging to identify IPs abusing XML-RPC.

4. | Rule Name          | Expression                               | Action     | Notes                           |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------- | ---------- | ------------------------------- |
| Block All XML-RPC  | `http.request.uri.path eq "/xmlrpc.php"` | Block      | When XML-RPC is not needed      |
| Allow Jetpack IPs  | `ip.src in {IP1 IP2 IP3}`                | Allow      | Whitelist Jetpack IPs           |
| Rate Limit XML-RPC | `http.request.uri.path eq "/xmlrpc.php"` | Rate Limit | Limit requests to prevent abuse |


5. Testing and Validation
After applying blocks or limits, test legitimate XML-RPC functions to ensure functionality is preserved.

Use tools like Jetpack debug or remote publishing clients.

6. Summary
Properly managing XML-RPC access is crucial to prevent brute-force, DDoS, and spam attacks on qisetna.com. Disabling or restricting XML-RPC combined with rate limiting and monitoring significantly reduces risk without impairing necessary functionality.
